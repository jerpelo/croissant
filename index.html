    <p>
      A croissant is a buttery, flaky, viennoiserie
      <span>(things of Vienna)</span> pastry of Austrian origin, but mostly
      associated with France. Croissants are named for their historical crescent
      shape and, like other viennoiseries, are made of a layered yeast-leavened
      dough. The dough is layered with butter, rolled and folded several times
      in succession, then rolled into a thin sheet, in a technique called
      laminating. The process results in a layered, flaky texture, similar to a
      puff pastry.
