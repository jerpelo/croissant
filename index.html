    <p>
      A croissant is a buttery, flaky, viennoiserie (things of Vienna) pastry of
      Austrian origin, but mostly associated with France. Croissants are named
      for their historical crescent shape and, like other viennoiseries, are
      made of a layered yeast-leavened dough. The dough is layered with butter,
      rolled and folded several times in succession, then rolled into a thin
      sheet, in a technique called laminating. The process results in a layered,
      flaky texture, similar to a puff pastry.
